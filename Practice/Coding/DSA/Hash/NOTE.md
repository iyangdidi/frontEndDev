# Hash Table

A Hash Table is a data structure designed to be fast to work with.

The reason Hash Tables are sometimes preferred instead of arrays or linked lists is because searching for, adding, and deleting data can be done really quickly, even for large amounts of data.

# Hash Set

A Hash Set is a form of Hash Table data structure that usually holds a large number of elements.

Using a Hash Set we can search, add, and remove elements really fast.

Hash Sets are used for lookup, to check if an element is part of a set.

Has constant time O(1) for searching, adding, and removing elements, which is really fast.

Worst case O(n).

To keep Hash Sets fast, it is therefore important to have a hash function that will distribute the elements evenly between the buckets, and to have around as many buckets as Hash Set elements.

# Hash Map

A Hash Map is a form of Hash Table data structure that usually holds a large number of entries.

Using a Hash Map we can search, add, modify, and remove entries really fast.

Hash Maps are used to find detailed information about something.
